FM-Localization
===========
The term “Localization” encompasses more than just translating field labels for your user interface. Other considerations may include translating field content, converting date formats, currency formats and even current exchange rates, among other issues.

For the scope of this sample, we will focus on translating our user interface, or UI, for the sake of simplicity. This may be all you need, but should get you started in any case.

There are lots of different techniques that have been around for a while now. The technique shown here attempts to show how you can leverage more recent features and development techniques with the goal of a narrow, lightweight, easy to manage solution.

There are a couple concepts that are used in this example.

  1. Namespaces for your Variables
  2. Setting Dynamically Named Variables

The file includes a working example of how to 
  a) manage different languages in your user interface, 
  b) set a given language as the default (load UI by default),
  c) set a given language as the selected one to load,
  d) load all variables when the file is opened, or a new language set is selected,
  e) automatically load all variables when refreshing a layout.
